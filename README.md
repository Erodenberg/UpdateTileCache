This sample provides an example of how to enable feature class change detection and use the results to update tiles in cache based only on changes. This will allow caches to be updated quickly without rebuilding the entire cache, which is time consuming, and resource intensive. At the ArcGIS 10.2 release, this model has works with one of two geoprocessing tools. Compare two feature classes in a file geodatabase or Show Edits since Reconcile Geoprocessing Tool. Compare two feature classes in a file geodatabase will create a feature class of changes features based on geometry and or attributes that have changed since the last update. The Show Edits since Reconcile geoprocessing tool generates a feature class of all the edits for a single feature class between versions in a multi-user geodatabase. Both tools can be used in this workflow to rebuild areas of a map cache where the underlying features have been edited.
